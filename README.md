# Report-on-Analysis-of-Diabetic-patients
It is an open secret that the treatment given by a doctor is not 100% accurate every time. Treatment given will be mainly influenced on tens of factors such as patients medical condition, medical history, other medications taken, age, gender, race, body type  etc. In addition to these complications, treatment will be given by prescribing appropriate medicine expecting it to work properly.  In the healthcare domain, Machine Learning(ML) is in its initial stages and is being considered as the potential solution for solving problems. In the current scenario, it is practically not possible for ML models to replace doctors. But ML can come in handy to the doctors in choosing the perfect medication for that particular individual.   The dataset is extracted from UCI repository. Dataset is available in the following link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008   Data is of size 101767*50. The features are about the gender, race, drugs, combination of drugs, hb1AC results etc. In this project, efficiency of the Insulin is calculated by doing Exploratory Data Analysis. Feature Engineering has also been done and number of features are increased. Using this data, several classification models were built to predict if the given patient has to be given insulin exclusively or combination of drugs. Several classification models were built out of which Voting Classifier yielded highest AUC of 83.3.
